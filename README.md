SmartFlip
=========

The application is a replacement for the Flip-3D windows manager introduced in Windows Vista.  
The windows are displayed using a carousel and many display and behaviour settings can be modified.  
It is written in C# and uses WPF and the Thumbnail API. The code is not very clean though, it was one of my earliest projects.  

The application won second place at "Hardware and Software Engineering" competition
held by the "Lucian Blaga" University, Sibiu, Romania in 2007.
