SmartFlip
=========

A replacement for the Flip-3D windows manager introduced in Windows Vista.  
The windows are displayed using a carousel and many display and behaviour settings can be modified.  

It is written in *C#* and uses *WPF* and the *Thumbnail API*. The code is not very clean though, it was one of my earliest projects.  
The application won in 2007 second place at *"Hardware and Software Engineering"* competition
held by "Lucian Blaga" University, Sibiu, Romania.
